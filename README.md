# 🏠 House Price Prediction

This project uses a Decision Tree Regression model to predict housing prices based on various features from the Boston housing dataset.

## 📊 Features
- Preprocessing and visualization of the housing dataset
- Training a Decision Tree Regressor
- Cross-validation with performance metrics
- Model serialization using `joblib`

## 📁 Files Included
- `Real Estate.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook
- `housing.data`, `housing.names` – Dataset from UCI ML repository
- `Dragon.joblib` – Trained model
- `model_output.txt` – Model performance summary
